#### History / The Sudoku Chronicles
1) I made a Sudoku solver for my school's AI class in python.
2) I then decided to rewrite it in java.
3) I further decided to hand it in as an APCS midterm project.
4) I was told the solver was perfect enough.
5) I went overboard.
6) WAY overboard.
7) Here we are now.

## Installing
1) Try to download and run the jar present in the 'target' subdirectory. Continue if error.
2) Clone the repository.
3) Execute setupJar.sh. This will surprisingly set up the .jar file.
4) Execute the jar. It will be in the 'target' subdirectory.
### WARNING!
DO NOT put jam in the jar. It may be tempting, but it will not work.

## Coming soon
* I'll think of something!
